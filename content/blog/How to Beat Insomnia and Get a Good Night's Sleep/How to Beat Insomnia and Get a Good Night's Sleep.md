# Have you or your loved ones experienced the following?

- Difficult to fall asleep at night.

- Wake up too early in the morning.

- Unable to have a good and long sleep.

  - Wake up at night: 1 am, 3 am, 5 am.
  - Wake up at least twice in the night.

- Loss of appetite…

# How can you beat insomnia and have a good night's sleep?

1. Sleep when you feel so

2. Relax your body and feel comfortable before going to sleep.

3. Keep the light out of the bedroom (as dark as possible). For someone who has **Nyctophobia** (extreme fear of the dark), keep the light at the lowest level that you are comfortable with

  - Try not to sleep with a nightstand light on 

4. Keep a fixed schedule for sleep and always go to bed at the same timeframe. A routine helps a long way!

5. Temperature matters

  - Soak your feet for 10min+ to stimulate warm blood flow around your body.

  - Take a warm shower (a cold shower in the morning would help you feel awake more)

  - Keep the room temperature at your comfort zone, generally around 65-70 Fahrenheit (18-21 Celsius). Let me know in the comment section what is your most comfortable temperature for sleep!

6. Exercise daily

7. Do one thing that makes you fully engaged. **Immerse yourself** in doing one thing each day has more benefits than you thought! (more on that topic later)

8. Eat at the same time of day, and try to keep bowl movement activities regular (if you can)

9. Use less or no electronics before going to bed.

  - Blue light can make you feel less sleepy.

  - Use the **night shift** to reduce blue light the night.

10. (Optional and only when necessary) Use the medication as a last resort to facilitate falling asleep at night

  - Consult with your doctor before taking any medication to facilitate sleep at night but don’t hesitate to seek medical help from your doctors.

  - Try not to take sleeping pills consecutively for too long, considering the various/slow half-times of the medications (consult with your doctors)

  - Unless it's OTC Melatonin, which the body won't accumulate and can digest without issues. (No need to worry about it getting accumulated because of half-time)

# Here are some more practical tactics to help you sleep better and beat insomnia

1. You can keep a sleep journal.

  - A journal to capture daily routine, including when to wake up / get up, when to go to bed, and the estimated sleeping time

2. Get out of bed (and bedroom) if you cannot fall asleep for more than 15min

  - Please be sure to cultivate the feeling of sleep before returning to bed.

3. Relax on your way

  - Dos

    - Whether it is doing meditation, practicing mindfulness (more on that later)

    - Praying

    - Getting into a massage chair

    - Yoga

    - Or just simply sitting in a room and doing nothing.

  - Dont's

    - Don't play with your cell phone/iPad, or computer.

    - Don't watch TV

    - Avoid electronics that could hinder Melatonin's natural release because of the blue light.

4. Be careful with going to your bed during the day.

  - Avoid napping altogether if you can

  - If you have to take a nap, limit it within 25min

5. Avoid drinks that could impact your sleep at night.

  - Alcohol

  - Coffee in the afternoon

    - According to the FDA, the half-life of caffeine is **between four and six hours**. If you drink a cup of coffee in the afternoon, half of the coffee or its substance is still in you when it's about bedtime. It's almost like you drink half a cup of coffee before bed!

    - Coffee is good for your heart and a lot of things (more on that later)

6. Don’t try to exercise fiercely (keep the exercise soothing and relaxed if you can) in the evening if you have trouble falling asleep at night.

7. Avoid overeating for dinner.

  - Eat like a king for breakfast, and less is better for dinner (more on that later)

# The benefit of getting a good night's sleep

1. The restoration of all of your body functions

2. The best way (and perhaps the only natural way) to Recharge

3. Restore vision

4. Empower memory

  - Cram for a test or eager to remember a lot of things? Try to take a look in the evening, and (biology) magic will happen automatically (more on that later)

The list goes on and on…

Give it a try with any of the tips that work for you! What is your secret weapon for getting a good night’s sleep?
