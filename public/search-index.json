[{"content":"\nDive into the fascinating world of human intelligence with Simon Roberts, the business anthropologist who unveils the secret sauce AI is still desperately trying to replicate ‚Äì embodied knowledge. Forget the tech jargon; Roberts takes you on a ride exploring how our bodies, with their movement, senses, and memories, bring a unique edge that artificial intelligence can\u0026rsquo;t quite grasp. Get ready for mind-bending examples of companies making killer decisions by combining data with hands-on learning experiences.\nTake-Aways ü§ñ While AI may be the buzz, there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of things we do effortlessly that machines can\u0026rsquo;t quite nail yet.\nüí≠ Kick Descartes to the curb ‚Äì mind and body aren\u0026rsquo;t separate entities. It\u0026rsquo;s time to embrace the idea that thinking isn\u0026rsquo;t just a brain thing.\nüìä Big data might be big, but it lacks the real-world vibes. Context and experience, folks, that\u0026rsquo;s where the magic happens.\nüëê Forget memorizing, start feeling! Embodied knowledge is all about observing, practicing, improvising, empathizing, and repeating.\nüöÄ Supercharge your strategy by blending emotions with this hands-on wisdom. It\u0026rsquo;s like turning your business plan into a blockbuster movie.\nSummary Step into the driver\u0026rsquo;s seat of understanding as Roberts dissects the art of driving. It\u0026rsquo;s not about reading a manual; it\u0026rsquo;s about feeling the road and experiencing the wind in your hair. AI may be great with numbers, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bit clueless when it comes to reading the unpredictable dance of the world around us.\nBreak free from the shackles of Cartesian dualism ‚Äì mind and body are BFFs, not foes. Your body\u0026rsquo;s got more smarts than Descartes gave it credit for. Feelings and senses aren\u0026rsquo;t distractions; they\u0026rsquo;re your secret weapons for navigating life.\nBig data might be throwing numbers around like confetti, but without the real-world context, it\u0026rsquo;s just a fancy spreadsheet. Our education system might be stuck on rote learning, but life\u0026rsquo;s best lessons come from hands-on experiences and a dash of chaos.\nEmbodied knowledge isn\u0026rsquo;t just a buzzword; it\u0026rsquo;s a power move. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re rocking a tennis match or concocting a culinary masterpiece, your body\u0026rsquo;s got the moves. It\u0026rsquo;s time to trust your gut ‚Äì literally.\nStrap in for a rollercoaster of insights ‚Äì from Duracell camping adventures to Facebook engineers exploring rural India. It turns out, to make great products and impactful decisions, you need to get your hands dirty, literally. AI might be catching up, but there\u0026rsquo;s something uniquely human about learning through experience.\nSo, if you think AI is about to take over the world, take a breath. Our embodiment, our visceral involvement with the world, is what sets us apart. While robots might rule at chess, human improvisation and fine motor skills still give us the upper hand in the messy, unpredictable real world. It\u0026rsquo;s time to celebrate our embodied intelligence ‚Äì the X-factor AI is still trying to crack.\nFurther reading Read ","date":"2024-04-24","id":0,"permalink":"/books/instinct-unleashed-the-power-of-not-thinking/","summary":"Dive into the fascinating world of human intelligence with Simon Roberts, the business anthropologist who unveils the secret sauce AI is still desperately trying to replicate","tags":["book-review","non-fiction","psychology"],"title":"Instinct Unleashed: The Power of Not Thinking"},{"content":"Well-thought-through product announcements will help increase feature awareness and engage users with new functionality.
